# MyLifeEasy

**A unified platform for students and working professionals relocating to new cities in India.**

---

## Platform Overview

### The Problem

Moving to a new city in India is overwhelming. Students, interns, fresh graduates, and working professionals face fragmented solutions across multiple apps and websites:

- Finding accommodation requires browsing 5+ apps with unreliable listings
- Essential services (food, laundry, repairs) are scattered across platforms with no quality guarantee
- Career support is disconnected from daily life needs
- No single source of truth for city-specific information
- Trust and safety concerns with unverified service providers

### The Solution

**MyLifeEasy** is a city-centric platform that consolidates everything a newcomer needs to thrive in a new city—from finding verified accommodation to daily essentials, career growth, and community engagement. Think of it as your **"City OS"** for seamless urban living.

### Target Users

- **Students** relocating for college or university
- **Interns & Fresh Graduates** starting their first job

## Initial City Focus

### Why Chennai, Tamil Nadu?

Chennai is the **pilot city** for MyLifeEasy due to:

- **Infrastructure Challenges**: Fragmented local services create demand for aggregation
- **Cultural Diversity**: Mix of students from across India seeking relocation support

### Scalability Plan

After establishing a strong foothold in Chennai:

1. **Phase 1**: Chennai → Expand within Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore, Madurai)
2. **Phase 2**: Bangalore, Hyderabad (other tech hubs)
3. **Phase 3**: Tier-2 cities across India (Pune, Jaipur, Kochi, etc.)
